## Commit Messages

Write commit messages like a human developer, not an AI. Keep them short and practical.

**Good:**

- `fix auth middleware using wrong headers`
- `add leads tab with message seeding`
- `rename customers to people`

**Bad:**

- `feat(auth): Fix middleware authentication by updating header retrieval method for improved session handling`
- `🎉 Add comprehensive lead management system with multi-step wizard and message seeding functionality`

No prefixes (feat:, fix:, chore:), no emojis, no verbose descriptions. Just say what you did.
